# Purpose

The purpose of this repo is for me to have a place to put R code for accessing and mapping New Zealand coastline data so that I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time I want to make a map.

# Set up

```{r}
1 + 1
```


# Stuff to avoid

- `maps::nzHires` has incomplete polygons and is incorrectly projected
