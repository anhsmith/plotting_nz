# plotting_nz

## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is for me to have a place to put R code for accessing and mapping New Zealand coastline data so that I don't have to reinvent the wheel every time I want to make a map.

This repo uses `southernMaps` data.

Avoid `maps::nzHires` because it has incomplete polygons and is incorrectly projected.
